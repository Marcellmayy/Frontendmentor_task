## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to use "%" instead of "px" for my image width and container width and height to enable me get a responsive styling for the webpage.

I learnt how to structure the divs and background coloring as well as embedding texts from google fonts

### Continued development

I would continue learning about styling and the grids to enable me undertand how to structure images.

### Useful resources

- [Eresource 1](https://www.googlefonts.com) - This helped me for get the html and css code for embedding the font family and styles. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
